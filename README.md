# Shitty dota mods

This project is just a meme. It contains set of scripts used to setup environment, develop and build app, which replaces DOTA 2 sounds (and maybe some other resources in the future). 

# Usage

After cloning this repo run prepare-env.bat, it will automatically setup virtual environment, that is used by other scripts.
- To apply all modifications use assemble-overrides.bat script (in the future this functionality will be moved to app). On the first run it will ask you to select steamapps dir.
- To build zip archive with portable executable use build-exe.bat
